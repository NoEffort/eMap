# eMap

This program is made as a non-profit open-source development process for use in my AP Computer Science class. This is a very basic Aplha version of any form of this program. All changes will be logged in the file system 'logs'.

Current Issues:
- Cannot figure out how to draw points on the frame using OOP under EMap.java and FrameUti.java
- Close function in FrameUtil.java not working (properly)
